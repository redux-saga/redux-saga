# babel-plugin-redux-saga

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2416](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2416) [`6707228`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/6707228c23c6cd8f54e4cde8d1fb1887c3831af1) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - `exports` field has been added to the `package.json` manifest. It limits what files can be imported from a package but we've tried our best to allow importing all the files that were considered to be a part of the public API.
