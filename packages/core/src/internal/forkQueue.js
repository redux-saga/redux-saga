/**
 Used to track a parent task and its forks
 In the fork model, forked tasks are attached by default to their parent
 We model this using the concept of Parent task && main Task
 main task is the main flow of the current Generator, the parent tasks is the
 aggregation of the main tasks + all its forked tasks.
 Thus the whole model represents an execution tree with multiple branches (vs the
 linear execution tree in sequential (non parallel) programming)

 A parent tasks has the following semantics
 - It completes if all its forks either complete or all cancelled
 - If it's cancelled, all forks are cancelled as well
 - It aborts if any uncaught error bubbles up from forks
 - If it completes, the return value is the one returned by the main task
