/**
 * Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a
 * specified action on the Store. The Generator is suspended until an action
 * that matches `pattern` is dispatched.
 *
 * The result of `yield take(pattern)` is an action object being dispatched.
 *
 * `pattern` is interpreted using the following rules:
 *
 * - If `take` is called with no arguments or `'*'` all dispatched actions are
 *   matched (e.g. `take()` will match all actions)
 *
 * - If it is a function, the action is matched if `pattern(action)` is true
 *   (e.g. `take(action => action.entities)` will match all actions having a
 *   (truthy) `entities` field.)
 * > Note: if the pattern function has `toString` defined on it, `action.type`
 * > will be tested against `pattern.toString()` instead. This is useful if
 * > you're using an action creator library like redux-act or redux-actions.
 *
 * - If it is a String, the action is matched if `action.type === pattern` (e.g.
 *   `take(INCREMENT_ASYNC)`
 *
 * - If it is an array, each item in the array is matched with aforementioned
 *   rules, so the mixed array of strings and function predicates is supported.
 *   The most common use case is an array of strings though, so that
 *   `action.type` is matched against all items in the array (e.g.
 *   `take([INCREMENT, DECREMENT])` and that would match either actions of type
 *   `INCREMENT` or `DECREMENT`).
 *
 * The middleware provides a special action `END`. If you dispatch the END
 * action, then all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will be terminated regardless
 * of the specified pattern. If the terminated Saga has still some forked tasks
 * which are still running, it will wait for all the child tasks to terminate
 * before terminating the Task.

/**
 * Spawns a `saga` on each action dispatched to the Store that matches

 *
 * #### Example
 *
 * In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchUser`. We use
 * `takeEvery` to start a new `fetchUser` task on each dispatched
 * `USER_REQUESTED` action:
 *
 *    import { takeEvery } from `redux-saga/effects`

 *    }
 *
 *    function* watchFetchUser() {
 *      yield takeEvery('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)
 *    }
 *
 * #### Notes
 *
 * `takeEvery` is a high-level API built using `take` and `fork`. Here is how
 * the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects
 *
 *    const takeEvery = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) => fork(function*() {

 *        const action = yield take(patternOrChannel)
 *        yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))
 *      }
 *    })
 *
 * `takeEvery` allows concurrent actions to be handled. In the example above,
 * when a `USER_REQUESTED` action is dispatched, a new `fetchUser` task is
 * started even if a previous `fetchUser` is still pending (for example, the
 * user clicks on a `Load User` button 2 consecutive times at a rapid rate, the
 * 2nd click will dispatch a `USER_REQUESTED` action while the `fetchUser` fired
 * on the first one hasn't yet terminated)
 *
 * `takeEvery` doesn't handle out of order responses from tasks. There is no
 * guarantee that the tasks will terminate in the same order they were started.
 * To handle out of order responses, you may consider `takeLatest` below.
 *
 * @param pattern for more information see docs for `take(pattern)`
 * @param saga a Generator function
 * @param args arguments to be passed to the started task. `takeEvery` will add
 *   the incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last

/**
 * Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a
 * previously forked task.
 *
 * #### Notes
 *
 * To cancel a running task, the middleware will invoke `return` on the
 * underlying Generator object. This will cancel the current Effect in the task
 * and jump to the finally block (if defined).
 *
 * Inside the finally block, you can execute any cleanup logic or dispatch some
 * action to keep the store in a consistent state (e.g. reset the state of a
 * spinner to false when an ajax request is cancelled). You can check inside the
 * finally block if a Saga was cancelled by issuing a `yield cancelled()`.
 *
 * Cancellation propagates downward to child sagas. When cancelling a task, the
 * middleware will also cancel the current Effect (where the task is currently
 * blocked). If the current Effect is a call to another Saga, it will be also
 * cancelled. When cancelling a Saga, all *attached forks* (sagas forked using
 * `yield fork()`) will be cancelled. This means that cancellation effectively
 * affects the whole execution tree that belongs to the cancelled task.
 *
 * `cancel` is a non-blocking Effect. i.e. the Saga executing it will resume
 * immediately after performing the cancellation.
 *
 * For functions which return Promise results, you can plug your own
 * cancellation logic by attaching a `[CANCEL]` to the promise.
 *
 * The following example shows how to attach cancellation logic to a Promise
 * result:
 *
 *    import { CANCEL } from 'redux-saga'
 *    import { fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'
 *
 *    function myApi() {
 *      const promise = myXhr(...)
 *
 *      promise[CANCEL] = () => myXhr.abort()
 *      return promise
 *    }
 *
 *    function* mySaga() {
 *
 *      const task = yield fork(myApi)
 *
 *      // ... later
 *      // will call promise[CANCEL] on the result of myApi
 *      yield cancel(task)
 *    }
 *
 * redux-saga will automatically cancel jqXHR objects using their `abort` method.

/**
 * Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to invoke the provided
 * selector on the current Store's state (i.e. returns the result of
 * `selector(getState(), ...args)`).
 *
 * If `select` is called without argument (i.e. `yield select()`) then the
 * effect is resolved with the entire state (the same result of a `getState()`
 * call).
 *
 * > It's important to note that when an action is dispatched to the store, the
 * middleware first forwards the action to the reducers and then notifies the
 * Sagas. This means that when you query the Store's State, you get the State
 * **after** the action has been applied. However, this behavior is only
 * guaranteed if all subsequent middlewares call `next(action)` synchronously.
 * If any subsequent middleware calls `next(action)` asynchronously (which is
 * unusual but possible), then the sagas will get the state from **before** the
 * action is applied.  Therefore it is recommended to review the source of each
 * subsequent middleware to ensure it calls `next(action)` synchronously, or
 * else ensure that redux-saga is the last middleware in the call chain.
 *
 * #### Notes
 *
 * Preferably, a Saga should be autonomous and should not depend on the Store's
 * state. This makes it easy to modify the state implementation without
 * affecting the Saga code. A saga should preferably depend only on its own
 * internal control state when possible. But sometimes, one could find it more
 * convenient for a Saga to query the state instead of maintaining the needed
 * data by itself (for example, when a Saga duplicates the logic of invoking
 * some reducer to compute a state that was already computed by the Store).
 *
 * For example, suppose we have this state shape in our application:
 *
 *    state = {
 *      cart: {...}
 *    }
 *
 * We can create a *selector*, i.e. a function which knows how to extract the
 * `cart` data from the State:
 *
 * `./selectors`
 *
 *    export const getCart = state => state.cart
 *
 *
 * Then we can use that selector from inside a Saga using the `select` Effect:
 *
 * `./sagas.js`
 *
 *    import { take, fork, select } from 'redux-saga/effects'
 *    import { getCart } from './selectors'
 *
 *    function* checkout() {
 *      // query the state using the exported selector
 *      const cart = yield select(getCart)
 *
 *      // ... call some API endpoint then dispatch a success/error action
 *    }
 *
 *    export default function* rootSaga() {
 *      while (true) {
 *        yield take('CHECKOUT_REQUEST')
 *        yield fork(checkout)
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * `checkout` can get the needed information directly by using
 * `select(getCart)`. The Saga is coupled only with the `getCart` selector. If
 * we have many Sagas (or React Components) that needs to access the `cart`
 * slice, they will all be coupled to the same function `getCart`. And if we now
 * change the state shape, we need only to update `getCart`.
 *
