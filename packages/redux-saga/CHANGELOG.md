### Minor Changes

- [#2295](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2295) [`bed4458`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/bed4458a79f21fd568a9d970968c9c8b8cbe1bf4) Thanks [@lourd](https://github.com/lourd)! - Adds type inference for result of task returned from runSaga and SagaMiddleware.run

* [#2296](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2296) [`612cae8`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/612cae81f0b8e6eb01b0b4c9ed961906be1fea98) Thanks [@lourd](https://github.com/lourd)! - Updates Channel type to eliminate void-emitting pitfall

- [#2308](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2308) [`8207e33`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/8207e33) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist), [@neurosnap](https://github.com/neurosnap)! - `exports` field has been added to the `package.json` manifest. It limits what files can be imported from a package but we've tried our best to allow importing all the files that were considered to be a part of the public API.

  This should fix the compatibility with Node.js ESM support.

### Patch Changes

- [#2261](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2261) [`5ae6578`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/5ae657844ce7d18153ddf7c3deb14c2c7ed81088) Thanks [@neurosnap](https://github.com/neurosnap)! - Require `CpsCallback` in all functions passed to the `cps` effect creator. This fixes a regression caused by TS 4.0 changing the behavior around spreading `never` into tuple types

* [#2004](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2004) [`20f22a8`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/20f22a8edd3bc66c2373ad31fb2c81e9bfed435f) Thanks [@gilbsgilbs](https://github.com/gilbsgilbs)! - A generic type has been added to the `Task` interface and that should be preferred over using a generic parameter in `Task#result` and `Task#toPromise`.

- [#2068](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/pull/2068) [`586179c`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/commit/586179c1b6183e320161d79d3709aa7f7ca2dde3) Thanks [@mikabytes](https://github.com/mikabytes)! - Added warnings when using `take(channelOrPattern)` incorrectly with more than one parameter. It helps to surface problem with `take(ACTION_A, ACTION_B)` being used instead of `take([ACTION_A, ACTION_B])`.
